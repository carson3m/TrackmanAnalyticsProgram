              <p>
                MoundVision Analytics was born from a passion for baseball and a recognition that 
                the game was evolving. As technology advanced and radar systems became more 
                prevalent, we saw an opportunity to bridge the gap between raw data and practical 
                coaching insights.
              </p>
              <p>
                What started as a solution for local teams has grown into a comprehensive analytics 
                platform trusted by coaches. Our team combines technical expertise with real-world 
                baseball experience, ensuring that every feature we build serves a practical purpose
                in player development and team strategy.
